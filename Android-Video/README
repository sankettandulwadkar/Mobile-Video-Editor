Runnable android project. main entrance: UIActivity

using FFmpeg and Bitmap to implement a media player.

many features are NOT implemented. Only could play video stream.


Some detail:
java: getNextDecodedFrame()
native: got the video stream bytes and return
java: bytes -> buffer -> bitmap -> draw


TODO:
not to use Bitmap. use native method.
OpenGL, even framebuffer.

try using SDL2 and continue the failed attempt i've made earlier.
